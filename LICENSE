Excerpt from project-redcap@googlegroups.com :

It is allowable under the REDCap license agreement for you to post ONLY the language file on GitHub (either in a public or private repository) if you wish to use GitHub as a means of having several people collaborate on the translation of the file (which is actually a pretty clever way to do it). But no other files from REDCap can be put on GitHub.
